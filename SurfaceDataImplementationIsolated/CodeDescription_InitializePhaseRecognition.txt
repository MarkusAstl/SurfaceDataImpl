QT - Initialize Phase Recognition

1) extremum_search(): Find all the extrema in the so far read in data and save the corresponding indices

2) Find last breath cycle duration and phase duration

3) Apply simple moving average filter to so far read in data and save smoothed values into smthdMovAvgList

4) Apply extremum_search() to smthdMovAvgList

5) Calculate mean of last three max shifts between data of the two different smoothing methods
