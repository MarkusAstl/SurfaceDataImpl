(5) emit LnReadingFinished(): SplitLn and ColNum are sent to MainWindow to show value in user interface

6) saveValsToList(): Convert strings from SplitLn into doubles and save values to TimeList and Amp1List. Also convert time value from ms to s

----- iteration = windowSize ---------------------

7) Calculate parameters for exponential moving average filter

8) Add all so far reat Amp1 values to smthdAmp1List to have n=windowSize values for starting filtering

9) Filter first datapoint

9) Define first time and amp1 value for setting up chart axis

10) emit CreateChart(): Create whole data chart
